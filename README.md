I forked Flexible-Jekyll from a repo quite generously provided by [artemsheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko).
I'm leaving their original README.md intact below for this GitHub repo but changing the content of just about
every other file here. If you want more info or to use this theme, I'd highly recommend you
go back to their oriignal repo (links below) and follow their instructions as I've removed
(incidentally/accidentally) much of their great documentation.

# Flexible-Jekyll is a simple and clean theme for Jekyll
