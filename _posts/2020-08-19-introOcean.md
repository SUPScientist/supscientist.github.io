I am very fortunate to be able to teach Intro to Oceangraphy which is, in my opinion, one of the most valuable courses taught at UNCW (OK, of course an oceanographer thinks that, but hear me out...). The ocean connects everything on Planet Earth; it affects humans and we affect it in countless ways. I believe that Introduction to Oceanography is especially valuable because it brings together students from majors all over UNCW--not just marine scientists. For many, it will be a springboard into an illustrious career of environmental stewardship; for others, it may be the last science course they ever take. I strive to make the science approachable to all while emphasizing the importance of human action (and deliberate inaction) for preserving and restoring this incredible part of our planet.
