Hi everyone! I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina and am happy to call Wilmington home. At UNCW, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Oceanography with a minor in biology and was a four-year student-athlete (soccer, not volleyball). I came in with a love for oysters and algae (which I still love) but soon was overjoyed to to be faced with a new opportunity that combined technology and community. Hence, I joined the COAST lab, working under Dr. Bresnahan, and have gained many new skills and joy for building low-cost open source sensors that ultimately benefit the community. In my undergraduate I also met my husband, Kevin! 

Alonside science, Kevin and I love to use sports to serve our community, especially the next generation. I spent most my summers from highschool and college playing and working with the Charlotte Lady Eagles. This Gospel-centered ministry introduces people to Jesus Christ, teaches them to follow Him, and empowers them as leaders through the global environment of soccer. Here is their website! https://www.charlotteeagles.com/ladyeagles

Now I am a M.S. Marine Science student focusing on coastal resiliency through flood monitoring, alerting, and community engagement. As you can tell I love being emmersed in the community and creating practical solutions for real-time issues. At UNCW I am currently involved in the Graduate Women in Leadership Association and Crossway Wilmington!
