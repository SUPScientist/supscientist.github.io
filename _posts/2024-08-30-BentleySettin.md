Hi everyone! I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina and am happy to call Wilmington home for now. At UNCW, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Oceanography with a minor in biology and was a four-year student-athlete (soccer, not volleyball). Coming to Wilmington was a wonderful blessing as I was able to play the sport I love while also mavigating through a few dimensions of marine science. I came in with a love for oysters and algae (which I still love) but soon was overjoyed to to be faced with a new opportunity that combined technology and community. Hence, I joined the COAST lab and have gained many new skills and joy for building low-cost open source sensors that ultimately benefit the community. 

Now I am a M.S. Marine Science student focusing on coastal resiliency through flood monitoring, alerting, and community engagement. As you can tell I love being emmersed in the community and creative practical solutions for real-time issues.
