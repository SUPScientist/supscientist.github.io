Cape Fear Community College student working at UNCW CMS for the the summer of 2022 on low cost sensor development and with the Coastal Ocean Research & Monitoring Program (CORMP) in '22â€“23. I have a background in public relations and journalism, now seeking to change careers and pursue work contributing to the exploration and preservation of marine ecosystems in North Carolina. I enjoy going camping with my family, bird watching, and lots of other nerdy stuff.
